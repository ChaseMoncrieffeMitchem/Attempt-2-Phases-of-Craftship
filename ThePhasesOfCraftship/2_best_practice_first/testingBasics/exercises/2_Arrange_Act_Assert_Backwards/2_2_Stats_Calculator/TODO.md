Description: Your task is to process a sequence of integer numbers to determine the following statistics: Without using system Math library functions, process a sequence of integers to determine the following statistics:

For example: [2, 4, 21, -8, 53, 40]

minimum value = -8, maximum value = 53, number of elements in the sequence = 6, average value = 18.666666666667

- DOING 
    -Checking through an array of numbers and processing certain statistical values of the numbers in that array

- KNOWINGS
    -knows the smallest number given an array of integers
    -knows knows the biggest number given an array of integers
    -knows how many intgers are present in the array
    -knows the average value of all the integers added up then divided by the number of integers

- EXAMPLES
    -minimum value = -8
    -maximum value = 53
    -number of elements in the sequence = 6
    -average value = 18.666666666667
